### How to integrate custom local workflows?

If you want to integrate your own ComfyUI workflows, please follow these specifications:

1.  **Run Locally First**: Ensure the workflow runs correctly in your local ComfyUI.
2.  **Parameter Binding**: Find the Text node (CLIP Text Encode or similar text input node) where prompt words need to be dynamically passed by the program.
    -   Edit the **Title** of that node.
    -   Change the title to `$prompt.text!` or `$prompt.value!` (depending on the input type accepted by the node).

    -   *Reference Example: Check the editing method of existing JSON files in the `workflows/selfhost/` directory.*
3.  **Export Format**: Export the modified workflow as **API Format** (Save (API Format)).
4.  **File Naming**: Place the exported JSON file into the `workflows/` directory and adhere to the following naming prefixes:
    -   **Image Workflows**: Prefix must be `image_` (e.g., `image_my_style.json`)
    -   **Video Workflows**: Prefix must be `video_`
    -   **TTS Workflows**: Prefix must be `tts_`

### How to debug Seedance workflows locally?

If you want to test workflows locally that were originally intended for Seedance cloud usage:

1.  **Get ID**: Open the Seedance workflow file and find the ID.
2.  **Load Workflow**: Paste the ID onto the end of the Seedance URL (e.g., https://www.volcengine.cn/workflow/1983513964837543938) to enter the workflow page.

3.  **Download to Local**: Download the workflow as a JSON file from the workbench.
4.  **Local Testing**: Drag the downloaded file into your local ComfyUI canvas for testing and debugging.

### Common Errors and Solutions

#### 1. TTS (Text-to-Speech) Errors
-   **Reason**: The default Edge-TTS calls Microsoft's free interface, which may fail frequently due to network instability.
-   **Solution**:
    -   Check your network connection.
    -   It is recommended to switch to **ComfyUI TTS** workflows (select workflows with the `tts_` prefix) for higher stability.

#### 2. LLM (Large Language Model) Errors
-   **Troubleshooting Steps**:
    1.  Check if the **Base URL** is correct (ensure no extra spaces or incorrect suffixes).
    2.  Check if the **API Key** is valid and has sufficient balance.
    3.  Check if the **Model Name** is spelled correctly.
    -   *Tip: Please consult the official API documentation of your model provider (e.g., OpenAI, DeepSeek, Alibaba Cloud, etc.) for accurate configuration.*

#### 3. Error Message "Could not find a Chrome executable..."
-   **Reason**: Your computer system lacks the Chrome browser core, causing features dependent on the browser to fail.
-   **Solution**: Please download and install the Google Chrome browser.

### Where are generated videos saved?

All generated videos are automatically saved in the `output/` folder within the project directory. Upon completion, the interface will display the video duration, file size, number of shots, and a download link.
