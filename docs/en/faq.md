## Configuration

### Q: Do I need to configure ComfyUI?

**Not necessarily** - it depends on your template choice:

|--------------|---------|----------|-------|
| Text-only<br/>(e.g., `simple.html`) | ❌ Not needed | Quotes, announcements, reading prompts | ⚡⚡⚡ Very fast |
| AI Images<br/>(e.g., `default.html`) | ✅ Required | Rich visual content | ⚡ Standard |

**Tip**: Beginners can start with text-only templates for instant zero-barrier experience!
